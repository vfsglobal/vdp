        <p>The BCEA states that the provisions for annual leave do not apply to an employee who works less than 24 hours per month for an employer, and also these provisions do not apply to leave granted to an employee in excess of the entitlement allowed in terms of the BCEA.</p>

        <p>The employer is prohibited by section 20(11) from paying an employee for annual leave except upon termination of employment. The only exception here would be if the employer allows more than minimum statutory annual leave per cycle. If the employee that only works 5 days a week is granted 20 paid days’ leave per cycle, then the 5 days in addition to the 15 paid days’ may be regulated by a policy and either be forfeited or paid out to the employee.
