              <p>A sick leave cycle is a period of 36 months employment with the same employer immediately following the date of commencement of employment, or the completion of the prior sick leave cycle. During the first 6 months of employment, the employee is entitled to 1 day sick leave for every 26 days worked. On the first working day of month number 7, the balance of the 30 days becomes available to the employee, less any days taken sick during the first 6 months of employment.</p>
              <p>The amount of the sick leave entitlement is a number of days that the employee would ordinarily have worked during a six-week period. In other words, if the employee works a 5-day week then it is 30 days sick leave in each leave cycle or every 3 years, or a 6-day week would result in 36 days sick leave a every 3 years.</p>
              <p>At the end of every 3-year cycle, any sick leave remaining untaken or unused is forfeited, and the next cycle begins with a fresh balance of 30 days or 36 days as the case may be. In instances where the employee is absent for more than 2 consecutive working days, meaning absent on 3 consecutive days or more, the employer is entitled to require proof of the illness or incapacity which caused the employees absence from work</p>
