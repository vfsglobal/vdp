        <section class="seperator">
          <h4 class="normal">Provident Fund [PF]</h4>
          <p>Provident Fund (PF) is one of the main employee benefits in India serving platform of savings for nearly all people working in any sector of organisations. It is a defined contribution plan for providing financial security and stability to the people at their retirement. Its purpose is to help employees save a fraction of their salary every month, to be used in an event that the employee is temporarily or no longer fit to work or at retirement.</p>
          <p>Provident fund is implemented by the Employees Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) of India. EPFO is a statutory body of the Indian Government under Labour and Employment Ministry. Any organisation having 20 or more employees is required by law to register with the EPFO.</p>
          <p>EPF is calculated on employee’s Basic+DA. An employee needs to compulsory register for EPF contribution if his Basic+DA is below INR 21,000. But if Basic+DA is above INR 21,000 then PF contribution is voluntary.</p>
          <p class="small_space">Employee Provident Fund is a fund which is composed of contributions made by the employee along with the contribution by his employer. Employee and employer both need to contribute 12% of Basic + DA. But, employer’s contribution is divided into 2 parts:</p>
          <ol type="1">
            <li>PF (3.67%)</li>
            <li>Employee Pension Scheme [EPS] (8.33%)</li>
          </ol>
         
          <p>PF payment cycle should be completed by 15th of every month.</p>

          <h4 class="normal">Gratuity:</h4>
          <p>Gratuity is a defined benefit plan and an important form of social security employee benefits. It is one of the many retirement benefits offered by the employer to the employee upon leaving his job. Gratuity is a part of the salary that is received by an employee from his/her employer in gratitude for the services offered by the employee in the company. An employee may leave his job for various reasons such as retirement, by way of voluntary retirement, resignation or for a better job elsewhere. Every factory or establishment would pay gratuity to its employees if employees are more than 10; according to Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972.</p>

          </ol>
          <p>If gross amount of an employee increases more than INR 21,000 during the employment then ESI is not calculated but one needs to complete the cycle compulsory from the above mentioned.</p>
          <p>The ESI funds are primarily built out of contribution from employers and employees payable monthly at a fixed percentage of salary paid.</p>

          <h4>Leave Encashment</h4>
        </template>
        <p>Leave encashment is one of the employee benefits in India. A salaried employee, whether in government sector or private, is entitled to various types of leave such as casual leave, sick leave, privileged leave and earned leave during their course of employment. Some of these leaves can be carried forward to the next year while others cannot. Employees can opt for encashment of these leaves if they haven’t availed them.
        </p>
        <p>In short, a benefit that an employer offers an employee whereby an employee can accumulate his/ her leave over a period of time and can encash for those accumulated leaves is known as leave encashment.</p>
        <p>However, the number of leaves that can be availed and encashed is decided by the employer and also needs to check whether the leave is encashed during the course of employment or at the time of retirement. The taxation is again dependent on whether an individual is a government or non-government employee.</p><br>

            <div class="main_content">
              <p>If an employee opts for encashment of leaves during his course of employment, the entire amount would be taxable under the head “Income from salary”. However, at the time of filing for returns, the exemption is allowed on a certain amount.</p>

              <p class="small_space">For leave encashment at the time of retirement, an employee is entitled to exemptions under Section 10(10AA). The amount, which is exempted, is different for government and non- government employees. Leave encashment for government employees is fully exempt from tax while non-government employees will be exempted on the least of the below :</p>

              <ul class="normal_list">
                <li>10 months’ average salary</li>

                <li>30 days of cash equivalent of unavailed leave for every year of service</li>
                <li>Maximum limit allowed by the government is Rs. 3 lakhs</li>
                <li>In case of resignation by the employee, the taxation applicable would be the same as that for retirement.

        <p>In case of death of the employee, the leave encashment would be received by his/her legal heir or nominee. The amount would be completely exempted from taxes for both government and non-government employees.</p>
        <p>Encashment of leave is a granted employee benefit and not a pensionary benefit.</p>
